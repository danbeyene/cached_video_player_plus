A Flutter package that simultaneously downloads, caches, and streams remote content. Perfect for media players and any plugin that streams web content.


# Motivation

The ability to simultaneously download and cache files remains a highly requested feature of video and audio playback plugins. 
By creating a local HTTP server, HttpCacheStream supports virtually any plugin that streams from web links. Unlike traditional caching solutions, HttpCacheStream works while the file is still downloading - allowing immediate playback of media files. 

### Features
- Simultaneous Download and Streaming - Start playing media instantly while downloading
- Persistent Caching - Cache files locally for offline playback
- Range Request Support - Efficient seeking in media players
- Resumable Downloads - Continue downloads after app restart
- HTTP Server - Works with any media player supporting HTTP URLs
- Custom Headers - Configure both request and response headers


# Getting Started
Using http_cache_stream to simultaneously cache and stream a video file:

```dart
import 'package:http_cache_stream/http_cache_stream.dart';

// Initialize the cache manager
await HttpCacheManager.init();

// Create a stream for a specific URL
final sourceUrl = Uri.parse('https://example.com/video.mp4');
final cacheStream = HttpCacheManager.instance.createStream(sourceUrl);

// Get the local cache URL to pass to your media player
final cacheUrl = cacheStream.cacheUrl;
// Example output: http://127.0.0.1:4612/example.com/video.mp4

// Use with any player
final videoPlayerController = VideoPlayerController.network(cacheUrl);
await videoPlayerController.initialize();
videoPlayerController.play();
```

See the example project to learn how to use http_cache_stream with [video_player](https://pub.dev/packages/video_player), [audioplayers](https://pub.dev/packages/audioplayers), and [just_audio](https://pub.dev/packages/just_audio)

## Platform configuration

Since http_cache_stream utilizes a localhost HTTP server, configuration is necessary to allow cleartext (non-HTTPS) connections:

### iOS/macOS

Add the following to your projects `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

### Android:

Create `android/app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<network-security-config>
	<domain-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true">
		<domain includeSubdomains="false">127.0.0.1</domain>
	</domain-config>
</network-security-config>
```

Reference the file in `android/app/src/main/res/AndroidManifest.xml` by adding the following entry under `application`:

```xml
    <application ... android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config">
```

See the example project for a full example.


# Core Components

## HttpCacheManager

The central manager for all cache streams:

```dart
// Initialize once
await HttpCacheManager.init();
final cacheManager = HttpCacheManager.instance;

// Configure global settings
cacheManager.config.requestHeaders[HttpHeaders.userAgentHeader] = 'MyApp/1.0';

// Create streams
final cacheStream = cacheManager.createStream(url);

// Manage cache
await cacheManager.deleteCache(); // Clear inactive cache
```

## HttpCacheStream

Manages downloading, caching, and streaming for a specific URL:

```dart
final cacheStream = cacheManager.createStream(Uri.parse('https://example.com/file.mp3'));

// Start download explicitly (optional)
cacheStream.download();

// Get download progress
cacheStream.progressStream.listen((progress) {
  print('Download progress: ${(progress * 100).toStringAsFixed(1)}%');
});

cacheStream.dispose(); // Release when done
```

## HttpCacheServer

Creates a local proxy server that dynamically handles URLs from the same source. Ideal for HLS/DASH streaming where a master playlist references multiple segment files. Cache streams are automatically created and disposed.

```dart
// Create a server for a base URL 
final sourceUri = Uri.parse('https://example.com/'); 
final cacheServer = await cacheManager.createServer(sourceUri);

// The URI of the cache server. Requests to this URI will be fulfilled from the source URI.
final serverUri = cacheServer.uri;

// Manually obtain a cache url
final hlsCacheUrl = cacheServer.getCacheUrl(Uri.parse('https://example.com/video.m3u8'));

cacheServer.dispose(); // Release when done
```


## CacheMetadata
Each cached file has associated metadata stored in a companion .metadata file, which contains:

- Original source URL
- Response headers from the server
- Additional cache information

```dart
// Get metadata for all cached files
final allMetadata = await cacheManager.cacheMetadataList();
final activeOnly = await cacheManager.cacheMetadataList(active: true);
final inactiveOnly = await cacheManager.cacheMetadataList(active: false);

// Get metadata for a specific URL
final metadata = cacheManager.getCacheMetadata(Uri.parse('https://example.com/video.mp4'));

// Delete cache files
await metadata?.cacheFiles.delete();
```

Metadata is automatically managed by HttpCacheStream, but you can also work with it directly to inspect or manipulate the cache without creating stream instances.



# Advanced Usage

### Cache Configuration

Configure both global and per-stream settings:
```dart
// Global configuration
final globalConfig = HttpCacheManager.instance.config;
globalConfig.requestHeaders[HttpHeaders.userAgentHeader] = 'MyApp/1.0';

// Per-stream configuration
final cacheStream = cacheManager.createStream(Uri.parse('https://example.com/file.mp3'));
cacheStream.config.copyCachedResponseHeaders = true;
```


### Range Request Controls
When a client requests a byte range that's significantly ahead of what's currently cached, the library can initiate a separate direct connection to the source, rather than waiting for the sequential cache download to reach that position. The `rangeRequestSplitThreshold` setting controls this behavior by defining how many bytes ahead a request must be to trigger a separate connection.

```dart
// Set the threshold for creating a split download (in bytes)
cacheStream.config.rangeRequestSplitThreshold = 5 * 1024 * 1024; // 5MB

// Disable split downloads
cacheStream.config.rangeRequestSplitThreshold = null;
```

### Cache Validation

```dart
// Check if cache is still valid
final isValid = await cacheStream.validateCache();
if (isValid == false) {
  // Cache is invalid, reset it
  await cacheStream.resetCache();
}

// Enable automatic validation of outdated cache
cacheStream.config.validateOutdatedCache = true;
```

## Credits

http_cache_stream began as a custom implementation of [just_audio](https://pub.dev/packages/just_audio)'s `LockCachingAudioSource`, a feature enabling simultaneous streaming and caching of audio files. Many thanks goes out to the developer and contributors of just_audio.
